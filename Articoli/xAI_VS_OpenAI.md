# Elon Musk’s xAI raises $6bn in bid to take on OpenAI

Elon Musk closed a $6bn dollar investement fot his artificial intelligence company called xAI. The startup is only 1 year old, but it rapidly developed itself. Generative AI has so far proven very expensive, needing a lot of computing power and energy to train the AI.

Musk relied on several of the investors who backed up his investments in the past, he included Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Fidelity Management & 
Research Company, and Kingdom Holding, a Saudi investor run by Prince 
Alwaleed bin Talal (a member of the Saudi royal family) as his investors for the project. 

The project was kicked off by OpenAI after Elon Musk, at the time co-founder of the company, decided to file a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging that Sam Altman and others had breached the founding agreement of the company, pursuing commercial succes instead of working to benefit humanity.

On Monday Musk repostedOn Monday Musk reposted xAI’s announcement on X, and wrote that the company has a “mission of understanding the universe, which requires 
maximally rigorous pursuit of the truth, without regard to popularity or political correctness”.

# Why AI is a disaster for the climate

The rapid adoption of generative AI, currently at the "peak of inflated expectations" according to the Gartner Hype Cycle, has sparked intense debate. While the technology promises transformative impacts, its significant environmental footprint is often overlooked. Training large AI models like GPT-2 requires immense computing power, resulting in substantial CO2 emissions—equivalent to 125 round-trip flights between New York and Beijing. The inference phase, where AI processes millions of user requests, further increases this footprint.

Despite the hype, it's crucial to consider the environmental cost. As AI becomes more widespread, its cumulative ecological impact could be significant. Current industry efforts to mitigate these effects through offsets and efficiency improvements are insufficient for addressing long-term challenges. A balanced approach is needed, where the benefits of AI are harnessed responsibly while actively managing and minimizing its environmental footprint.

In summary, while generative AI is currently hyped, a realistic assessment of its environmental impact is essential. Greater transparency and accountability in evaluating and mitigating AI's ecological footprint are necessary to ensure sustainable technological progress.

### Perché Musk ha una nuova azienda AI?

Per competere con OpenAI

### Quale è la missione della nuova azienda?

La missione della nuova azienda è comprendere l'universo 

### Descrivi una delle principali problematiche relative all'AI

L'intelligenza artificale, per quanto possa essere benevola, ha bisogno di molta potenza di computazione e necessita di molta energia elettrica, producendo di conseguenza emissioni di anidride carbonica molto elevate.
